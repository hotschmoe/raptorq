# Gap Inventory

Known gaps between the current implementation and full RFC 6330 conformance.

(All features are gaps at this stage - see docs/discovery/FEATURES.md for the full feature list.)

## Template

When identifying a gap:

```
### G-XX: Short title
- **Feature**: Which feature (F01-F26) this relates to
- **Description**: What is missing or incomplete
- **Severity**: Critical / Major / Minor
- **Blocked by**: Any prerequisite gaps
```
